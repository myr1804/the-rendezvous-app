## MVP Stories:
As a user, I want to go to a link that opens up to a welcoming homepage that invites me to login or create new profile.

As a user, after I log in/create a profile, I would like to see a page that list my events in chronological order and a calendar view. I should be able to access my friends list and add new friends and remove friends

As user I should be able to create new, edit or delete event and invite other friends/other people to my events. I want to be able to block time to let other user know that I am not available during this time.

As a user I should be able to let other friends see the title of my other events on the shared calendar and other details of event should remain hidden/private.

As a user I want to accept invitations from other users with the options of yes, no or maybe; maybe with the option to see other people who are also attending the event

As a user I want to log out.
